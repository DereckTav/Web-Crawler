/**
 * The App class provides functionality for crawling hyperlinks from a given root URL.
 * It leverages multithreading to efficiently crawl and extract links using a thread pool.
 * The class ensures that only valid URLs are processed and supports concurrent processing
 * for faster crawling.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Validates the root URL using Apache Commons UrlValidator before processing.
 * - Uses a fixed thread pool of 5 threads to process the URLs concurrently.
 * - Crawls links starting from the root URL and adds them to a crawled collection.
 * - Returns a set of all the crawled links.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - Apache Commons Validator (UrlValidator)
 * - ExecutorService for handling thread management
 * - CountDownLatch for synchronizing multiple threads
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Instantiate the App class.
 * 2. Call the getHyperLinkOf() method with a root URL to start the crawling process.
 * 3. Use returnLinks() to retrieve the set of crawled URLs after the process completes.
 * 
 * Example:
 * App app = new App();
 * app.getHyperLinkOf("https://example.com", new CountDownLatch(5));
 * Set<String> links = app.returnLinks();
