/**
 * The Spider class is responsible for crawling and processing web pages concurrently.
 * It is a part of a multi-threaded system that uses a queue to manage URLs and tracks crawled URLs.
 * 
 * Each Spider instance crawls a page, discovers hyperlinks, and adds them to the queue for further crawling.
 * The Spider can also spawn new threads (baby spiders) to crawl additional pages concurrently.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Handles initial crawling of a root URL and subsequent pages.
 * - Uses a queue to manage discovered URLs and ensure concurrent crawling.
 * - Tracks discovered and processed URLs using the Crawled object.
 * - Implements the Runnable interface to run concurrently with other spiders.
