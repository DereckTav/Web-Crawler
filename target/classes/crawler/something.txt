I think that visited URLs isn't needed


look at it this way

- main thread is listening -

First lets figure out how we handle multiple connections (request)

(event driven (async I/O (what is it))) (1 thread can handle thousands of connections)
1 (set of urls, stack, etc...)
2 (set of urls, stack, etc...)
3 (set of urls, stack, etc...)

BEFORE MOVING ON HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS!!




(argument what if 1 and 2 have visited the same links?) 
(each link has its own visited urls, need 10 valid links)
(depends on purpose)

we have a connection

intial thing sends links 

1 has - workers to help it (what should 1 do help or wait) 
        (2 scenarios 1 waits (acts a connection 10 links, then send back) and 1 helps)
      - what do these workers do (they get links and add valid links )


// req.

 - it is a black boxed component of code.
 - it gets info
    - preferably static method
 - this would be thread safe
